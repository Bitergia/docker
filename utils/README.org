Here you can find some scripts and utilities to use when using our
baseimages.

* docker-stop

This script sends the SIGPWR signal to /sbin/init inside the
container, triggering the shutdown process and allowing the running
services to cleanly shutdown.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
docker-stop <container-id> [<container-id>...]
#+END_SRC

* docker-ssh

This script helps using ssh to log into a running container by setting
some default options and looking up the container ip from the
container name.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
docker-ssh [ssh options] <user>@<container-id> [command]
#+END_SRC

When using our baseimages, the default ssh private key is
${HOME}/.ssh/bitergia-docker.  To use another identity, add the -i
parameter with the desired key.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
docker-ssh [ssh options] -i /path/to/my/private-key <user>@<container-id> [command]
#+END_SRC

* docker-scp

This script helps using scp to transfer files from/to a running
container with a running ssh daemon.  

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
docker-scp [scp options] <user>@<container-id>:path/to/remote/files path/to/local/files
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
docker-scp [scp options] path/to/local/files <user>@<container-id>:path/to/remote/files
#+END_SRC
